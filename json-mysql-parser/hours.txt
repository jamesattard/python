Goal 1 (Mysql to JSON parser):
-----------------------------

Notes:
I did not see the footnote about the commit history so I initially squashed everything in one commit - I pushed everything again in 4 different iterations (so please do not mind the timestamp of the commit history) - this is to indicate that it took me about 4 iterations in total to achieve the result.

Hours dedicated:
1) Research to query MySQL - 30min
2) Research to use JSON - 30min
3) Research to use requestbin - 10min
4) Coding and fixing encoding issues - 2h

Total time to script this ~ 3h
